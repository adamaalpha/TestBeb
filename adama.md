## Introduction
 This page compares the performance of DiVinE, SPIN and LTSmin. 

 The BEEM models were written in DVE format which can be directly parsed by
 DiVinE and LTSmin. A translation to Promela enables these models to be used in SPIN. 
 However, the translation also introduces differences in the state and transition count 
 rendering the performance results incomparable. Other models are simply too small to 
 obtain measurable results. Therefore, the set of models can be limited to those of interest.
